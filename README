AutoHDMI
========

Udev rule and scripts to automatically enable your HDMI output when you plug the wire.
The udev rule launch a script that does 3 tasks:
- Tell Alsa (and other daemon based on Alsa) that the default sound should go through HDMI
- Ask XRandR to find a suitable mode to clone the display through HDMI
- run any executable script in the /etc/connected.d/ or /etc/disconnected.d/ directories.

You could edit /etc/alsa/asound-hdmi-connected.conf and /etc/alsa/asound-hdmi-disconnected.conf to adjust it with your settings.
`CARD` and `DEV` variable will be replaced by your card/device match HDMI output or regular one.
This detection is done by `hdmi-switch` and you can modify it if the detection is not good enough.
Please send me a patch or pull-request if you find a better detection scheme.

Adjust /etc/xrandr/xrandr-hdmi-disconnect.sh to match your regular display settings.
By default, it uses the primary ouptput with recommanded resolution.

You can also ajust /etc/xrandr/xrandr-hdmi-connect.sh when your HDMI is connected.
By default, it uses xrandr-clone that tries to clone your primary display using a common resolution.

`xrandr-clone` uses `xrandr-find-best-mode-for-clone` that uses `xrandr.py`.
The later depends on python-xlib. Be sure to have the latest version.
  pip install --upgrade svn+https://python-xlib.svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/python-xlib/trunk/
Note: subversion/svn is needed to complete the command. You may need to run this as root or use `sudo`.
